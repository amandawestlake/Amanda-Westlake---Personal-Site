        <p id="intro"> Hey there! My name is Amanda (she/her), and I'm a rising senior at <a href="http://tufts.edu" target="_blank">Tufts University</a>, where I study Computer Science with Political Science and English minors. My current role is as a Technical Writer intern at <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>, where I write technical documentation for a developer audience. Specifically, I write about <a href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/multi-cloud" target="_blank">Anthos Multi-Cloud</a>, a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a> product that allows clients to efficiently manage <a href="http://kubernetes.io" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> applications in multiple public clouds. In the past, I've worked as a field organizer and intern on various political campaigns, and was the Managing Editor of the <a href="https://tuftsobserver.org" target="_blank">Tufts Observer</a>, a biweekly newsmagazine and Tufts's oldest publication. I'm deeply interested in the art of communicating complex ideas effectively, the intersections of technology and social issues, the importance of good documentation, climate justice, community organizing, and all types of writing. </p>

        <p>Some of my proudest accomplishments are my work as the Ed Markey for Senate campaign's youngest field organizer and a co-founder and leader of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/08/18/ed-markey-ad-youth-vote-kennedy-397351" target="_blank">Students for Markey</a>, and my writing and editing with the Observer. Watch my <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEKuOq17o5g" target="_blank"> video with Senator Markey</a> about his advocacy to end Alzheimer's disease, and learn about the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1__4z1J6FxjrGU1AKOQg9VJKYlfbTuiu4QqK0hT8fb_Y/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">phone bank goal thermometer</a> I created that's been used and <a href="https://docs.everyaction.com/docs/other-solutions" target="_blank"> shared </a>by campaigns across the country. At Tufts, I'm also a teaching assistant for <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/comp15/" target="_blank">Data Structures (CS15)</a>, and I spent summer 2021 empoweringing  young people to close the gender gap in tech as a TA with the <a href="http://girlswhocode.com" target="_blank">Girls who Code</a> Summer Immersion Program. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, cooking, crossword puzzles, ceramics, Tetris, film photography, and antiquing.</p>
