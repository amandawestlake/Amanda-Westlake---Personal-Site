        <p id="intro"> Hey there! My name is Amanda, and I study Computer Science and Political Science at Tufts University. I've worked as a field organizer and intern on various political campaigns at the national, state, and local levels, and am currently the managing editor of the <a href="https://tuftsobserver.org" target="_blank">Tufts Observer</a>, a biweekly magazine and Tufts's oldest publication. I'm interested in the intersections of politics and technology, tech for good, journalism, and climate justice advocacy. In my free time, I enjoy reading, crossword puzzles, ceramics, Tetris, and antiquing. </p>
        <p>Some of my proudest accomplishments are my work as a field organizer on the Ed Markey campaign and as a co-founder and leader of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/08/18/ed-markey-ad-youth-vote-kennedy-397351" target="_blank">Students for Markey</a>, and my writing and editing with the Observer. Watch my <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEKuOq17o5g" target="_blank"> video with Senator Markey</a> and learn about the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1__4z1J6FxjrGU1AKOQg9VJKYlfbTuiu4QqK0hT8fb_Y/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">phone bank goal thermometer</a> I created that's been used and <a href="https://docs.everyaction.com/docs/other-solutions" target="_blank"> shared </a>by campaigns across the country! At Tufts, I'm also a hub coordinator of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sunrisetufts" target="_blank">Sunrise Movement</a> and a teaching assistant for Data Structures (CS15). </p>
