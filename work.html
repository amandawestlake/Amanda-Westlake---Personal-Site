        <h2>Leading the Massachusetts High School Democrats</h2>
        <p>As Chairwoman of the MA High School Dems (MAHSD), I led an organization of over thirty chapters of high school students from across the state. We lobbied for bills, campaigned for local candidates, and registered students to vote. Watch me introduce Senator Warren at our 2019 Summit here!</p>

        <h2>Campaigning for Elizabeth Warren</h2>
        <p>I worked on Senator Warren's 2018 re-election campaign as an intern, then on the Warren 2020 presidential campaign as an intern in NH. During the 2019-2020 school year, my freshman year of college, I was the co-president of Tufts for Warren! We organized dozens of Warren supporters and volunteers on Tufts' campus.</>

        <h2>Students for Markey</h2>
        <p>In spring 2020, I started Students for Markey with a few of my friends to support US Senator Ed Mareky. The group grew to over 500 members, and we regularly held relational and traditional voter contact events. Our virtual, completely grassroots model, was groundbreaking and highly successful; Markey won an unprecedented amount of youth support. During this time, I also worked officially with the campaign as a digital distributed organizing fellow, where I organized national volunteers.  </>
